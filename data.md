We can filter down to the MROs through the "nonpfrea" column, which stands for "Reason for non-PF status". Value 05 means "Medical research organization (described in 170(b)1)(A)(i))‚Äù.

Here's a glimpse at a few rows of this data, along with the codebook's column descriptions: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g37FcUYw_TG_6pv5zA53nNRDLRTSN0ngpJQVpaGIB2o/edit?usp=sharing

The codebook/reference manual for this dataset is at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/16eofinextractdoc.xls

Apparently some organizations have missing 990s for some fiscal years, so we need to look across several years of 990s to get a list of all MROs. We can compare our extracted list to another list Jeff shared (though I didn't catch its source): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FE82tYg-WIgUvnjA70y-z9Cas29Hqa2rjnoVfv9qLVE/edit?usp=drive_web.

## NCCS core trend files

Julia Lane also pointed us to NCCS core trend files (http://nccs-data.urban.org/index.php), which seem to be compilations of the 990s and may prove useful.
